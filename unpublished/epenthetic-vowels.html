    <h2 class="essay-title"> Epenthetic Vowels in Japanese </h2>
<h3 class="by-line"> by Nathalie M. Luna | October 2020 </h3>

<p>Two ways in which different languages vary are their phonemes and their syllable inventory. Different languages might share some phonemes, but they might also have different ones. <b>When a person hears a phoneme from a foreign language, they might map it to a similar phoneme in their own native language</b> (Best, 1994). For example, Japanese language does not have the lateral alveolar liquid [l]. So, when they encounter this phoneme they map it to the closest phoneme, the retroflex alveolar liquid [ɹ].</p>

<p>Different languages might also have different rules which dictate which types of syllables (sequence of phonemes) are allowed. <b>When a language adopts a word from a foreign language, the “illegal” syllables (if any) of these loan words are changed to conform to these rules.</b> The particular way in which Japanese does this change is studied by Itô &amp; Mester (1995). </p>

<h4>Vowel Epenthesis</h4>

<p>The Japanese syllable inventory is: V, VV, CV, CVV, CVN, and CVQ, where V is a vowel, C is a consonant, and Q is a geminate (or double) consonant. So, <b>when they adopt a word with a consonant cluster that is not allowed, they add a vowel to break it up</b>. This is called vowel epenthesis. And when they adopt a word with a syllable-final consonant that is not allowed, they add a vowel to the end of the syllable. These changes are consistent and may be described as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li style="margin: 2px;">The syllable of XC form is changed to XCO whenever C is a dental stop.</li>
<li style="margin: 2px;">The syllable of XC form is changed to XCU whenever C is a non-dental stop and a non-nasal consonant.</li>
</ul>

<p>So the question is why do these changes invariably happen. Some plausible answers are:</p>

<h5>“Muscle memory” in speech production</h5>

<p>Japanese speakers rarely articulate consonant clusters and may have lost the chance to develop the skill to do so.</p>

<h5>Orthographic restrictions</h5>

<p>There are no characters in their alphabet (the kanji, katakana, or hiragana characters) to represent a single consonant, except for [n]. They do have the characters to turn a consonant into a geminate consonant. But there is no way their alphabets can write most consonant clusters.</p>

<h5>Vowel epenthesis at a subconscious level</h5>

<p>The phonotactic constraint that disallows consonant clusters influences how the native Japanese speaker perceives those prohibited sequences of phonemes. Because they do not produce consonant clusters in their native language, they can’t recognize them when they hear it.</p>

<h4>Studies on Vowel Epenthesis</h4>

<p>The possibility that phonotactic constraints affect phoneme perception has been studied by Massaro and Cohen (1983) and by Hallé, Segui, Frauenfelder, and Meunier (1998). Dupoux et al. have designed a series of experiments which they hope will yield more accurate and reliable results. </p>

<p>They hypothesize that <b>"listeners impose the phonology of their native language on unfamiliar linguistic stimuli”</b> (Dupoux et al., 1998, p. 6) . In particular, they study the Japanese’s vowel epenthesis and the French’s non-distinction of vowel length. Here are some properties of their experiments which they hope will make a difference:</p>

<h5>They use naturally-produced unambiguous speech stimuli.</h5>

<p>While other experiments used synthesized and ambiguous stimuli, Dupoux et al. <b>recorded and edited human voices</b>; one female and one male. They each were recorded producing sixteen triplets of the following forms: </p>

<table>
<tr> <th> Form: </th>
	<td> V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub> </td>
    <td>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub>UC<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub> </td>
    <td>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub>UUC<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub> </td>
</tr>
<tr> <th> Example: </th> 
	<td> ebzo </td>
    <td> ebuzo </td>
    <td> ebuuzo </td>
</table>

<p>With the exception of the first form, all other syllables are valid in Japanese. And all of them are valid in French.</p>

<h5>They implement a cross-linguistic design.</h5>

<p>Previous experiments were done in a single language. This makes it difficult to claim that their findings are only applicable to that particular language. Dupoux et al. had 10 native Japanese speakers and 10 native French speakers. Both knew some English, but had begun learning a second language after the age of 12.</p>

<p>Dupoux et al predicted that <b>because Japanese doesn’t allow consonant clusters, they will have difficulty differentiating form 1 and 2 (epenthesis contrast)</b>. French, on the other hand, allows complex consonant clusters and should therefore have no difficulty.</p>

<p>Because, in French, vowel length is not contrative, <b>French speakers were predicted to have difficulty distinguishing form 2 and 3 (vowel length contrast)</b>. For Japanese, on the other hand, vowel length is contrastive, so it should have no difficulty. <i>If each group exhibited the predicted traits, that would be evidence that each trait was language-specific.</i> </p>

<h5>They use a speeded ABX paradigm.</h5>

<p>In the experiment, they gave 128 experiment trials to each participant. An experiment trial consisted of:</p>

<ul>
<li style="margin: 2px;">A,B: Two different forms of a triplet (the epenthesis contrast or the vowel length contrast) spoken by a female.</li>
<li style="margin: 2px;">X: Either A or B spoken by a male.</li>
</ul>

<p>After each trial, the participant had to determine whether X was the same as A or as B. <b>Dupoux et al used different speakers to avoid having the participants rely on the acoustic representation.</b> They want to study how the participants use their linguistic/phonological skills to process the stimuli; not how well they hear and distinguish abstract sounds.</p>

<p>Additionally, the experiment required participants to perform a speedy response. This should <b>reduce the likelihood that they use complicated response strategies; again, forcing the participants to rely on their phonological skills/knowledge</b>. </p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Results showed that French-speakers had indeed more difficulty (higher response time and higher error rate) with the trials with vowel contrast when compared to Japanese-speakers. <b>This exemplifies Best’s theory</b>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Japanese-speakers had more difficulty with the trials with epenthesis contrast when compared to French-speakers. <b>This is evidence for Massaro and Cohen’s findings</b>. These results shed some light on the debate of perception versus production as the focus of phoneme teaching in the L2 classroom. Because perception is affected by the speaker’s native language’s constraints, this should not be the sole focus.</p>
