	<h3 class="eye-grabber">Handmade Lacy Shawl Scarf</h3>

	<p>You can wear this shawl loosely draped around your shoulders for a touch of casual elegance. Or wrap it snuggled up against your neck for more warmth. </p>

	<p>The lace design is perfect for those cool Spring evenings and transitional weather. </p>

	<p>This  shawl measures approximately 18 inches wide and 60 inches long.</p>

	<p>This shawl is handmade using 100 percent acrylic from the Caron Simply Soft line (my personal favorite!) for easy care. </p>

	<p>This shawl is made to order in the color of your choosing. You can take a look at the color options in the pictures; but if you don't see anything you like, we can find more shades.</p>

	<p>This lovely lace will take about a week to finish. Once it's done, it will be shipped via USPS First Class Mail. Have different shipping preferences? Let's talk.</p>

	
	<h3 class="eye-grabber">Mobius Infinity Scarf Hand-Made with 100 percent Wool Yarn</h3>

	<p>Keep your neck warm and your outfit stylish with a 100 percent wool Mobius strip. </p>

	<p>A Mobius strip is a mathematical surface with only one side. This means that if you place your finger on your scarf and run it straight down the middle without lifting your finger, you can cover "both sides" of your scarf and return to the same spot you started. It's all one side! Could we argue that this is the <b>real</b> infinity scarf? Maybe.</p>

	<p>The scarf is made with Patons Classic Wool yarn. It approximately measures five feet in length and 6 inches in width. And the stitching is one of my personal favorites. </p> 

	<blockquote>How to care for it: </blockquote>

	<p>This scarf was hand-made with great care for the quality of the stitching and of the materials. To better care for your scarf, please wash it by hand and lay flat to dry. Your scarf will appreciate it greatly.

	<blockquote>How to complete the look:</blockquote>

	<p>You can pair your Mobius Infinity Scarf with this fabulous <a><u>matching beanie</u></a> </p>

	<p>Both make great, thoughtful gifts for a friend, relative, or special person. The sets come in gold, plum, and pacific teal.

	
	<h3 class="eye-grabber">Slouchy Beanie Hand-Made with 100 precent Wool </h3>

	<p>This slouchy beanie is a comfortable and cute way to keep yourself warm. Slouch it to the side for an extra chic look.</p>

	<p>The beanie is made with Patons Classic Wool yarn. It approximately measures 9.5 inches in length and 21 inches in circumference. And the stitching is one of my personal favorites. </p>

	<blockquote>How to care for it: </blockquote>

	<p>This beanie was hand-made with great care for the quality of the stitiching and of the materials. To better care for your beanie, please wash it by hand and lay flat to dry. Your beanie will appreciate it greatly.</p>
