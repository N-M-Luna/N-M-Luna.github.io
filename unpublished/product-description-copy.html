    	<h4>Handmade Crochet Cat Bonnet </h4>
     
	<p>There is an agreement between cats and humans: We lovingly dress them in cute outfits, and in return, they claw the things we love and blatantly show us their butts. Keep this tradition alive with this crochet hat for your feline friend!</p>

	<h5 style="color: #302301;">Dimensions</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>It features two 1.5 inch openings that comfortably fit their ears. </li>
		<li>The main part of the hat measures 5 inches across the middle. </li>
		<li>Each of the long tails, which are used to secure the hat in place, measures 6.5 inches long.</li>
	</ul>

	<h5 style="color: #302301;">Materials and Constructions</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>This cat bonnet hat is handmade.</li>
		<li>Made with 100&#37; acrylic yarn.</li>
		<li>The colors pictured are ready to be shipped to you.</li>
		<li>Don't see what you're looking for? Your hat can be made in any color you would like. Two colors? We can do that too. Stripes? Sure! Let's message.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Handmade Lacy Shawl Scarf</h4>

	<p>You can wear this shawl loosely draped around your shoulders for a touch of casual elegance. Or snuggle with it up against your neck for more warmth. </p>

	<p>The lace design is perfect for those cool Spring evenings and transitional weather. </p>

	<p>This shawl is handmade using 100&#37; acrylic for easy care. </p>

	<p>Your shawl will be made to order in the color of your choosing from the Caron Simply Soft line (my personal favorite!).</p>

	<h4>Mobius Infinity Scarf Hand-Made with 100&#37; Wool Yarn</h4>

	<p>Keep your neck warm and your outfit stylish with a 100&#37; wool Mobius strip! </p>

	<p>A Mobius strip is a mathematical surface with only one side. This means that if you place your finger on your scarf and run it straight down the middle without lifting your finger, you can cover "both sides" of your scarf and return to the same spot you started. <i>It's all one side!</i> Could we argue that this is the <b>real</b> infinity scarf? Maybe.</p>

	<p>The scarf is made with Patons Classic Wool yarn. It approximately measures five feet in length and 6 inches in width. And the stitching is one of my personal favorites. </p> 

	<h5 style="color: #302301;">How to care for it: </h5>

	<p>To better care for your handmade scarf, please wash it by hand and lay flat to dry. Your scarf will appreciate it greatly.

	<h5 style="color: #302301;">How to complete the look:</h5>

	<p>You can pair your Mobius Infinity Scarf with this fabulous <a><u>matching beanie</u></a> </p>

	<p>Both make great gifts for a friend, relative, or special person. The sets come in gold, plum, and pacific teal.</p>

	
	<h4>Slouchy Beanie Hand-Made with 100&#37; Wool </h4>

	<p>This slouchy beanie is a comfortable and cute way to keep yourself warm. Slouch it to the side for an <i>extra chic</i> look!</p>

	<p>The beanie is made with Patons Classic Wool yarn. It approximately measures 10 inches in length and 21 inches in circumference. And the stitching is one of my personal favorites. </p>

	<h5 style="color: #302301;">How to care for it: </h5>

	<p>To better care for your beanie, please wash it by hand and lay flat to dry. Your beanie will appreciate it greatly.</p>

	<p>This throw features fun, tri-color chevron stripes that can lighten up your living room. It can also be used to add a vintage look, as well as a layer of warmth, to your bedroom.</p>
