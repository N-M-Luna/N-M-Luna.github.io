<h2 class="essay-title"> Q-Talk Guide </h2>
<h3 class="by-line"> by Nathalie M. Luna | August 2013 </h3>

<blockquote>Skynet Labs is creating a household automaton to abolish hard work. As part of their programming, the scientists have created an artificial language. </blockquote>

<p>SKYNET Labs thanks you for your purchase of this Q-506 Clean-O-Matic. The latest model in the Q-series features a variety of enhancements expertly fine-tuned, based on the performance of its predecessor, the Q-320 model. We guarantee it will provide you the latest technology in automatic household cleaning for years to come. </p>

<p>The Q-talk language cartridge has been pre-installed in all of our Q-series models. The useful remote that has been integrated since the Q-105 model is still compatible with this latest model. And for ease of use, their integrated microphone is also actively recording any time the Q-model is on. You only need to speak within a 20-feet radius for the automaton to pick up your instructions. (For more information on commands, see Addendum 1.2.)</p>

<p>With the optimum household cleaning services in mind, our engineers have focused their time and energy into revamping the previous model’s sweeping algorithm and battery usage. For this reason, the vocal cord algorithm pre-installed on the Q-506 model is still limited.  However, the Q-talk expansion card (not included) has much more vocabulary. It will also allow you to add new words.  Read through this manual to gain a better understanding of their simple language. </p>

<p>Table 2.3.1 below shows some vocabulary words to help illustrate and exemplify the morphological processes of Q-talk. (You may find a more complete list in Addendum 2.4.)</p>

<h4>How to make a noun plural</h4>

<p>Pluralization of nouns is done through reduplication. Reduplication is a morphological process in which the input word or part of it is repeated to create a new (output) word which may be an inflection or a derivation of the input. </p>

<p>In this case, the input will be a singular noun and the output will be its plural inflection. Nouns in Q-talk are composed of three phonemes, two stop consonants and a non-open vowel between them. </p>

<p>To pluralize a noun, its vowel is reduplicated. </p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>Bip (dish) ➜ Biip (dishes)<br>
Bup (mop) ➜ Buup (mops)</p>

<blockquote>Note: Reduplication can also be heard in Q-90+ models, who will chime “wu-wu” after having completed a task. </blockquote>

<h4>How to inflect a verb for past tense</h4>

<p>Verbs inflect for past tense through reduplication and affixation. Affixation is a morphological process in which the input word (a free morpheme) is augmented by a word fragment (a bound morpheme) to create a new output word which may be an inflection or a derivation of the input word.</p>

<p>In this case, the input word is a verb (in its infinitive form) and the output is the past tense of the verb. Verbs consist of the consonant w and a non-open vowel. </p>

<p>The first step for a verb to inflect for past tense is the reduplication of the vowel. The second step is the affixation of the bound inflectional suffix -u.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>wi (to clean) ➜ wiiu (cleaned) <br>
we (to sleep) ➜ weeu (slept) </p>

<blockquote>Note: All Q-models will chime “Pip weeu” in the morning or at whatever time you schedule to automaton to power-on.</blockquote>

<p>There is one verb, wu (to finish), that does not follow this rule. The past tense of wu is not wuuu. </p>

<h5>Special case: Past tense of wu</h5>

<p>Inflection of the verb wu (which means to finish) for past tense is done through suppletion. Suppletion is a morphological process in which a morpheme inflects by changing completely. For any word that inflects through suppletion, the inflections tend to have an altogether different root.</p>

<p>In this case, the past tense of the verb wu is biup.</p>

<p>wu [wu] (to finish)  ➜ biup [biuph]	(finished)</p>
 	 		

<p>Another instance of suppletion can be observed in the Q-320 model. There have been reports of a bug in this model which tenses the noun Bip for plural as Blup, not Biip. We believe this bug will be fixed in the Q-506 model.</p>

<h4>How to inflect a verb for future tense</h4>

<p>Verbs inflect for future tense through alternation. Alternation is a morphological process in which the input word (a free morpheme) does through an internal modification of its phonemes to create the output, which can be an inflection or derivation of the input.</p>

<p>In this case, the input word is a verb (in its infinitive form) and the output is the verb in future tense. We have mentioned before that verbs in Q-talk consist of the consonant w and a non-open vowel. </p>

<p>Whenever a verb is inflected for future tense, the consonant w will be replaced by the consonant b.</p>

<p>For example,</p>
<p>wu (to finish) ➜ bu (will/must finish)<br>
we (to sleep) ➜ be (will/must sleep)</p>

<blockquote>Note: Q-30+ models will chime “Pip be” when their power banks are depleted.</blockquote>

<h4> How to use adjectives</h4>

<p>Adjectives are used exclusively as predicative complements. However, there are no linking verbs in Q-talk. So, the use of predicative adjectives is accomplished through compounding. Compounding is the morphological process of joining two independent words (free morphemes) to create a new word. In general, the two inputs may be joined by a hyphen, an empty space, or no space at all.</p>

<p>In this case, the input words are a noun and an adjective. The output (both words joined by a hyphen) can be interpreted as a complete sentence.</p>

<p>To describe something, the noun may be compounded with the adjective and joined by a hyphen.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>Bub (floor) + hyphen + pib (clean) ➜ Bub-pib (The floor is clean.)<br>
Biip (dishes) + hyphen + bib (dirty) ➜ Biip-bib (The dishes are dirty.)</p>

<blockquote>Note: Automatons will rarely use adjectives when going through their household tasks. But they have been programmed to use adjectives when they enter their smalltalk subroutine. </blockquote>



<p>Thank you for putting your trust in SKYNET Labs. We are confident that you are now ready to take your Q-506 Clean-O-Matic out for a spin. Let Q-506 take care of a couple of chores and you’ll be a Q-talk expert in no time!</p>
