<h2 class="essay-title"> Linguistic Autobiography </h2>
<h3 class="by-line"> by Nathalie M. Luna | January 2020 </h3>

<p>I was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Both my parents are monolingual Spanish speakers, as most of their generation. If I trace my lineage, I think there are Spanish roots; and history says that’s likely. But the part of my family tree that I know is all from the island. </p>

<p>Being a US colony, English came to me when I was young. Both Spanish and English classes are required in school and in most undergraduate programs. However, I honestly don’t think I learned how to read/speak English from classes. Most of the English I learned was from the American TV I watched growing up, and from all the books I read. The most challenging part of learning English (and probably Spanish, too!) was prepositions. </p>

<p>I went to college in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. In one of the mandatory basic Spanish courses, the professor discussed the difference between Standard Spanish and what we hear anywhere else. She spoke affectionately about the words we use and which can’t be found elsewhere. It wasn’t until then that I stopped thinking about the way I speak as “bad Spanish” and I appreciated our unique way of speaking. </p>

<p>In college, I took a semester of French and two semesters of Japanese. I (very ambitiously) bought a French copy of Harry Potter to practice. I have a very superficial understanding but I think it will get better if I’m consistent.  As for Japanese, I learned about their sentence structure and particles, which do make a lot of sense to me. Apart from a few words that I learned because they sounded fun and exotic to me, I don’t have much of a vocabulary. And when it comes to hearing spoken words, I had no hope for understanding more than disconnected phrases in French or Japanese.</p>

<p>I was, however, fluent in “bad Spanish” and in Spanglish. Most of my generation are bilingual and very often switch from one language to the other mid-sentence. Of course, I didn’t realize this until I came to the Valley in 2017 and had conversations with English-speaking people. I would notice confusion in their faces and, once I was done talking, they would tell me that I started speaking Spanish halfway through. I had to condition my brain to not deviate from English, so I believe I have lost that skill. For the first month or so of living in the Valley, I would get home from school with a slight headache from having to translate every time I opened my mouth.</p>

<p>Now, I have been in the Valley for three years now and I am dating a monolingual English speaker. So, I often think in English; and I’m forgetting Spanish words! I began practicing by including more Spanish books to my never-ending reading queue and by writing in Spanish more often. When I first came to the Valley, I was happy that I would be living in a place with so many Spanish-speaking people. But during the first week of living here, some people had trouble understanding me, especially when I spoke at my regular speed. So, of course, I got embarrassed, switched to English as my default, and now I only speak Spanish with a couple of people who can understand me. </p>

<p>The last adventure in linguistics that I had was a fellowship in Japan, in the Summer of 2018. I stayed for a month in a small town in Yamaguchi. There weren’t many people who spoke enough English to have a conversation and I thought that in two months, I would be able to make small talk. But I didn’t learn as much as I thought (or as much as I would’ve liked) because I was too shy to speak a foreigner’s Japanese. (The first time I had to ask for rice at a supermarket, I melted from embarrassment!) I did learn how to read Hiragana, Katakana, and some Kanji, all very useful in reading signs and in ordering food. I also carried my little phrasebook to every trip I made. But the language is so different from anything I know that it didn’t feel like a “real language” coming out of my mouth. It felt like a magical incantation that would somehow impart the knowledge of my message in their heads. </p>

<p>Now, I have set a new academic direction for myself. I want to learn about language and do some interesting research. I believe that writing mathematical proofs have made me understand (English) sentence structures better. And studying math has made me aware of the subtleties a language can have. Math is, after all, the most precise and unambiguous language I know.</p>
