-This shawl is handmade using 100 percent acrylic from the Caron Simply Soft line (my personal favorite!) for easy care.

	Mobius Infinity Scarf Hand-Made with 100 percent Wool Yarn

Dimensions: 12, 7, 4 inch
Weight: 7 oz

Description:
Keep your neck warm and your outfit stylish with a 100 percent wool Mobius strip. 

A Mobius strip is a mathematical surface with only one side. This means that if you place your finger on your scarf and run it straight down the middle without lifting your finger, you can cover "both sides" of your scarf and return to the same spot you started. It's all one side! Could we argue that this is the *real* infinity scarf? Maybe.

The scarf is made with Patons Classic Wool yarn. It approximately measures five feet in length and 6 inches in width. And the stitching is one of my personal favorites. 

How to care for it:

This scarf was hand-made with great care for the quality of the stitching and of the materials. To better care for your scarf, please wash it by hand and lay flat to dry. Your scarf will appreciate it greatly.

How to complete the look:

You can pair your Mobius Infinity Scarf with this fabulous matching beanie: [link]
Both make great, thoughtful gifts for a friend, relative, or special person. The sets come in gold, plum, and pacific teal.

The beanie is made with Patons Classic Wool yarn. It approximately measures 9.5 inches in length and 21 inches in circumference. And the stitching is one of my personal favorites.
