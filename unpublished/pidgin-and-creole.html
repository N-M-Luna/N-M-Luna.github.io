<h2 class="essay-title"> Differences between Pidgin and Creole Languages </h2>
<h3 class="by-line"> by Nathalie M. Luna | August 2020 </h3>

<p>Knowing what you know, explain why pidgins are usually languages with no consistent grammatical/morphological/phonological rules (they may vary both from speaker to speaker, and also within speaker and not in a sociolinguistic way), but creoles are fully fledged languages with consistent language rules shared by multiple speakers. What does it take for a pidgin language to become a creole language? Why do you think that is? What does that say about the human capacity for language and the social aspect of language?</p>

<p>Pidgin languages can be described as make-shift languages or Frankenstein creations (if Dr. Frankenstein was a linguist instead of a physician). They are created out of the need to communicate simple thoughts to people who don’t share a common language. Users of pidgin languages have no need to  agree upon rules of syntax or build an elevated vocabulary. They need only the sentences to make enough sense to get a message across. The message is usually technical, not abstract, and related to a common job.</p>

<p>Pidgin languages have no need for an agreed-upon grammar because no one is actively studying these languages. They borrow elements from their correspondents’ languages and include them in this “baby language” in an intuitive way that will make enough sense to get a message across. This is done in a trial-and-error kind of way so the rules will inevitably vary from person to person. Or a pidgin language speaker might change syntax or morphology to make the message understood by different interlocutors.</p>

<p>Pidgin languages suggest a kind of intuition about grammar or what can be grammatical. It also suggests that this linguistic intuition is a shared knowledge or skill. This is why I believe that language is innate. This assumption would explain why two adults can not only make up a new language in such a short period of time, but also understand a mix-and-match language without direction.</p>

<p>Sometimes, pidgin languages survive past the initial trial-and-error stage. In these cases, the language spreads to other areas of human interaction beyond the workplace (or wherever it originated). Once a pidgin language reaches the home, it is learned by the next generation in the same way that established languages are learned. </p>

<p>After some generations have learned this pidgin language and use it, the variations are smoothed out and the grammar is agreed upon by popular use. Once the pidgin language gets enough use, its rules become consistent. Once this happens, then the pidgin language can be properly called a “real language”. Languages that are born from pidgin languages are called creole languages.</p>
