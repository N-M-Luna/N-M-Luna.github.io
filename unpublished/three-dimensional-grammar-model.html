<h2 class="essay-title"> Three-Dimensional Grammar Model</h2>
<h3 class="by-line"> by Nathalie M. Luna | November 2020 </h3>

<!-- Reference the paper I learned all this from -->

<p>The <b>three-dimensional grammar model</b> describes grammar as made up of three areas or dimensions: <ul> <li>form/structure,</li> <li>meaning/semantics, and</li> <li>use/pragmatics.</li> </ul></p>
 
<p>The <b>structure dimension</b> describes the form of the language. It is usually associated with traditional or prescriptive grammar and it deals with things like how words are formed, the sounds of words, and the structure of sentences.</p>
 
<p>The <b>semantics dimension</b> describes the meaning of words and clauses. There are lexical words like <i>house, love, summer, play, thought,</i> and <i>jump</i>, which have meanings in the physical world. And there are grammatical words like <i>the, a, but, or,</i> and <i>and</i>, whose meanings describe their function in grammar.</p>
 
<p>The <b>pragmatics dimension</b> describes the speakers’ preferred choice of some clause constructions over others that have the same meaning. It usually deals with social or literary contexts. </p>
 
<p>For example, let’s take a look at <i>passive voice clauses</i> through each dimension of grammar. The structure dimension will answer how it is formed, written, and spoken. The semantics dimension will answer what it means. And the pragmatics dimension will answer when or why it is used.</p>
 
<h4>Structure dimension of passive voice clauses.</h4>

<p>To study the way passive voice is formed, we will compare it to a canonical clause’s structure. Canonical clauses are said to be in active voice. In active voice clauses, the subject corresponds to the active participant (or actor) of the tensed verb. If the verb has an object, then it is called the passive participant (or patient). </p>
 
<p>A <b>prototypical active voice clause</b> might have the following form:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">ACTOR + auxiliary + AdvP + V in <i>x</i> tense + PATIENT</p>

<p> In this active voice clause, the auxiliary and the adverb phrase are optional. </p>
 
<p>The structure dimension will deal with how we construct <b>the corresponding passive voice clause</b>. That would be:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">PATIENT + auxiliary agreeing with the actor + AdvP + be in x tense + V in pp tense + ACTOR</p>

<p> Note here that the patient is now the subject of the sentence in passive voice. </p>
 
<h4>Semantic dimension of passive clauses. </h4>

<p>The semantic dimension will we focus on what the clause means. <b>A passive clause it is semantically identical to its corresponding active voice clause</b>. While the form of each clause described above is different, the corresponding forms will have the same meaning.</p>
 
<h4>Pragmatics dimension of passive clauses. </h4>

<p>A strict prescriptivist will argue that there is no use for the passive voice. That it’s a wrinkle in the language; a mistake that is repeated too often in bad writing. A descriptivist will take a look at when it is used in writing to determine why that structure perseveres despite so many style handbooks arguing against it.</p>
 
<p><b>The passive voice is favored when the patient represents old or familiar information</b>. This is often used in narratives to <i>ensure coherence</i> and ease transition from one sentence to the next. </p>
 
<p><b>It is also be used when there isn’t much information about the actor</b>. For example, we might not know who the actor is. On the other extreme, the actor might be obvious or unimportant. In these cases, the passive voice will shift the attention or emphasis to the patient. </p>

<h4> Conclusion </h4>

<p>This three-dimensional grammar model can be applied to any aspect of grammatical studies. It can be used to disect any grammatical object that you would like to understand in greater depth. </p>
