<h2 class="essay-title"> Foreign Accents </h2>
<h3 class="by-line"> by Nathalie M. Luna | September 2020 </h3>

<blockquote> A linguistic explanation for the non-linguist </blockquote>

<p>Explain to a person with little or no knowledge of linguistics why people who have different language backgrounds (a first language other than English) may have different accents when they speak English as a second language (focus on phonology/phonetics exclusively). </p>

<p>This should be based on the idea that learners transfer their knowledge from their first language’s phonological repertoire. Remember to use examples to illustrate your point and to make it as simple as possible for everyone to understand. Please resort both to phonetic as well as to phonological reasons for second language accent.</p>

<p>Languages sound very different from each other. This is not only because they form words using different sequences of sounds; although that’s certainly part of it. Different languages might have altogether different sounds in their alphabet and vocabulary. For example, I remember liking to say “Hanukkah” because it has that fun-to-pronounce “ch” sound, almost like you’re clearing your throat. Or you might have a hard time ordering a schnitzel at a German restaurant. That’s probably because you’re not used to having those three consonants (or consonant sounds) all together or at the beginning of a sentence. So, any native English speaker would feel that putting together those three sounds is counterintuitive or, at the very least, kind of odd.</p>

<p>Every language has these particularities; certain sounds or sound combinations that other languages might not have. When a person grows up in a certain language these peculiarities come to be intuitive. They are not just part of the rules of their native language, but they also become part of how they view human language in general.</p>

<p>So what happens when a person learns a second (or third, or n-th) language? They encounter a new set of rules.  Essentially, this person is trying to go against how they think language should be spoken. Learning how to override your instinct that says “You don’t say those three consonant sounds together” is very difficult. Or learning how to reproduce a sound you have never made in your life is no easy task. Many times, a person speaking that non-native language will reproduce an approximation of the “correct” sounds. This is what we know as a “foreign accent”. For example, in the Japanese language, there is no “l” sound. So, when a native-Japanese speaker talks to me, they call me “Natari,” instead of Nathalie. </p>
