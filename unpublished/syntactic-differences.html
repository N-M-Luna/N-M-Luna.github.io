<h2 class="essay-title"> Syntactic Differences between Spanish and English </h2>
<h3 class="by-line"> by Nathalie M. Luna | December 2020 </h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The following article, where we compare the syntax of the English and Spanish languages, was written for a Descriptive Linguistics course. This material is also available in <a title="Follow me to YouTube!" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoBRrc9ueFw&ab_channel=NathalieM.Luna"><u>audiovisual format</u></a>. In this paper, we compare <b>the most common types of clauses</b> and discuss key differences in <b>the word order of each language</b>. The main references used for this paper are two textbooks published by the Cambridge University Press. And both books follow a descriptive approach to linguistics. Additional sources were used for the topic of psychological verbs.</p>

<h4>Canonical Clauses</h4>

<p>Canonical clauses are composed of a subject and a predicate. A <b>subject</b> will usually take the form of a <i>noun phrase</i>, which has a noun as its head. A <b>predicate</b> (in its most simple version) will consist of a <i>verb phrase</i>, which has a verb as its head. Linguists use certain characteristics of the verb to classify clauses. Let’s continue by taking a closer look at verbs and their different forms.</p>


<h5>Verb Paradigms and the Subject</h5>

<p>In the English language, verbs have six forms: three primary and three secondary forms. The <b>primary forms</b> can be used to represent the <i>present tense</i> (in this case, we chose between the <b> third-person singular present</b> and the <b>plain present</b> forms so that the verb agrees with the subject) or the <b>preterite tense</b> (in which case, we use the preterite form no matter what the subject is). The <b>secondary forms</b> (which are the plain form, the gerund participle, and the past participle) can’t be used by themselves in the canonical clause. Below is a table showing the paradigm of the verb “sing”. </p>

<table>
<tr>
<th> plain present </th>
<td> sing </td>
</tr> 

<tr>
<th> 3rd sing present </th>
<td> sings </td>
</tr> 

<tr>
<th> preterite  </th>
<td> sang </td>
</tr> 

<tr>
<th> gerund participle </th>
<td> singing </td>
</tr> 

<tr>
<th> plain form </th>
<td> sing </td>
</tr> 

<tr>
<th> past participle </th>
<td> sung </td>
</tr>


</table>

<p>English verbs <b>tense only for past and preterite</b> and they agree with the number of the subject only in the present tense. <i>Other tenses, moods, and aspects are achieved through a combination of auxiliary and lexical verbs.</i></p>

<p><b>Spanish, on the other hand</b>, has a specific verb form for each tense, mood, and aspect. For example, here are the forms of the verb “cantar” (sing).</p> 

<table style="width: 100%;">

<p>The morphology of the verb forms in Spanish <b>reflects the number and person of the subject</b> in all inflections, except the imperative, the infinitive, the past participle, and the gerund participle form. Therefore, even if the subject of a Spanish canonical clause does not appear explicitly, we can still recover the number and person of the missing subject.</p> 

<p>For example, consider the following sentence:</p>

<center>
<p><i>Cantaremos en el festival.</i></p>
</center>

<p>Note that this sentence is composed of a verb phrase; <b>there is no noun phrase whose grammatical function is the subject</b>. However, we can recover that lost information if we take a look at the morphology of the verb: </p>

<center>
<p><i>cant-a-re-mos,</i></p>
</center>

<p>First thing we can notice is the <i>-a</i> morpheme, which is the <b>thematic vowel</b> of the verb (it indicates the category of the verb). The <i>-re</i> morpheme indicates that the verb is in <b>future tense</b> and <b>indicative mood</b> (that is, it talks about a factual situation as opposed to a hypothetical one). Lastly, the <i>-mos</i> morpheme tells us that the verb has a <b>1st person plural subject</b> (that is, the subject can be replaced by the pronoun nosotros/we).</p>


<p>On the other hand, if we try to extend this to English, the first translation problem we encounter is that <b>there is no primary tense for English verbs to represent the future</b>. Instead, we resort to the use of combinations of auxiliaries and verbs in their secondary form to express the desired mood (which can refer to the future time). In this case, English uses the modal <i>will</i> and the main verb in plain form to express an <b>epistemic mood</b>, which refers to possible future outcomes based on what the speaker knows at the time of utterance.</p> 

<p>The English translation would be:</p>

<center>
<p><i>We will sing at the festival.</i></p>
</center>

<p>If if we try to imitate Spanish and omit the subject, we will have the ungrammatical sentence:</p>

<center>
<p><i>*Will sing at the festival.</i></p>
</center>

<p>English requires a subject to be present. The only exception is imperative clauses, where “you” is usually the understood subject.</p>

<h5>Transitive Verbs</h5>

<p><b>Transitive verbs</b> are verbs that have a direct or indirect object as their complement. A <b>direct object</b> is commonly a noun phrase, and it can be replaced by <i>a pronoun in the accusative case</i>. In English, the accusative case pronouns are <i>me, us, you, him, her, it,</i> and <i>them</i>. </p>


<p>In the sentence,<p>

<center>
<p><i>Juliette read her book,</i></p>
</center>

<p>the noun phrase <i>her book</i> is the direct object and can be replaced by the accusative pronoun <i>it</i>:</p>

<center>
<p><i>Juliette read it.</i></p>
</center>

<p>In Spanish, the direct object can also be replaced by a pronoun in its accusative form. These are <i>me, te, le, la,</i> and <i>lo</i>.</p> 

<p>For example, the sentence </p>

<center>
<p><i>Julieta leyó su libro,</i></p>
</center>

<p>has the noun phrase <i>su libro</i> as the direct object and can be replaced by <i>lo</i>. This pronoun will appear, not where the noun phrase it replaced was, but <i>before</i> the verb:</p>

<center>
<p><i>Julieta lo leyó.</i></p>
</center>

<p>However, in sentences that have a predicate with a verb phrase of the following form: </p>

<center>
<p>verb form of <i>ir</i> + “a” + infinitive verb</p>
<p>(verb form of <i>go</i> + “to” + infinitive verb),</p>
</center>

<p>in these cases, the pronoun can also appear after the verb. </p>

<p>For example, the sentence </p>

<center>
<p><i> Voy a vender mi casa,</i></p>
</center>

<p>has the noun phrase <i>mi casa</i> as the direct object and it can be replaced by the pronoun <i>la</i>. This pronoun can go <i>before</i> the verb phrase:</p>

<center>
<p><i> La voy a vender,</i></p>
</center>

<p> or it can go after the verb phrase:</p>

<center>
<p><i> Voy a venderla.</i></p>
</center>

<p> In Spanish, the addition of pronouns is considered as a type of inflection of the verb. The pronoun is considered a <b>bound morpheme for verb-object agreement</b>. The reason for this classification is that while the pronoun can indeed replace the object, we could also have a grammatical sentence with both the accusative pronoun and the object present.</p> 

<p>For example, we can have the sentence</p>

<center>
<p><i> Le di el libro,</i></p>
</center>

<p>where the pronoun <i>le</i> refers to an indirect object that is 3rd person singular. If we pick “a Juan” to be the indirect object, then the sentence with both the pronoun and the indirect object is also grammatical:</p>

<center>
<p><i> Le di el libro a Juan.</i></p>
</center>

<p> If we attempt the first construction in English, we have </p>

<center>
<p><i>I gave him the book,</i></p>
</center>

<p> where the indirect object <i>him</i> corresponds to <i>le</i> (even though the words are in different order) and the direct object is <i>the book</i>. On the other hand, if we attempt a literal translation of the second construction, we end up with an ungrammatical clause:</p>

<center>
<p><i> *I gave him the book to John,</i></p>
</center>

<p>
or something similarly disastrous: </p>

<center>
<p><i> *I gave him John the book.</i></p>
</center>


<h5>Simple and Complex Verbs</h5>

<p>Verbs can be classified depending on whether they have a predicative complement (<b>complex verbs</b>) or not (<b>simple verbs</b>). A <b>predicative complement</b> (often referred to as PC) is a complement of the verb and it usually takes the form of a noun phrase, similar to a direct object. The difference between a PC complement and an object is that the PC refers to the same entity as the subject. </p>

<p>For example, consider the following sentences.</p>

<center>
<p><i> She is a doctor. </i></p>
<p><i>George became a professor.</i></p>
</center>

<p>The noun phrases <i>a doctor</i> and <i>a professor</i> are predicative complements because they represent the same entity as the subject, <i>she</i> and <i>George</i>, respectively. </p>

<p>An interesting fact about predicative complements is that the PC noun phrase doesn’t require a determinative when it’s a title (such as president, Secretary of State, treasurer, etc.). For example, </p>

<center>
<p><i>She is president now. </i></p>
<p><i> George is Secretary of State.</i></p>
</center>

<p>In Spanish, sentences with complex verbs are called “Oraciones Copulativas”. And the predicative complement does not require a determinative. For example,</p>

<center>
<p><i> Ella es doctora.</i></p>
<p><i>Ella es presidente.</i></p>
</center>

<h4>Psych Verbs</h4>

<p>In English, the so-called psych verbs <b>express a mental state</b>. For example, verbs like <i>like, love, delights, frighten,</i> and <i>bore</i> are psych verbs. Most verbs have <i>an actor</i>, usually associated with the subject in canonical clauses. And many verbs have a <i>patient</i>, usually associated with the object in canonical clauses. Psych verbs have an <b>experiencer</b> of the mental state that the verb represents and a <b>theme</b> which causes the experience. In English, the experiencer will usually be the subject or the  direct object of the clause. For example, consider  the sentence: </p>

<center>
<p><i> Marie hates politics.</i></p>
</center>

<p> In this sentence, <i>Marie</i> (the subject) is the experiencer because she is the one experiencing the hate. And <i>politics</i> (the direct object) is the theme that causes hate in Marie. On the other hand, in the sentence</p>

<center>
<p><i>Politics angers Marie,</i></p>
</center>

<p><i>Marie</i> (the direct object) is the experiencer because she is the one experiencing the anger. And <i>politics</i> (the subject) is the theme that is causing the reaction of Marie.</p>

<p>In English, most psych verbs come in pairs like hates/angers. So psych verbs can be classified in two categories. One category contains <b>verbs whose subject is the experiencer</b>. And the other category contains <b>verbs whose subject is the theme</b>.</p>

<p>In Spanish, the <b>experiencer of the psychological verb is always the object</b> and the <b>theme is always the subject</b>. Sentences with psych verbs can follow a Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) word order, an OVS order, or an SVO order. For example, the following sentences have the same meaning: </p> 

<center>
<p><i>El café le gusta a mi hermano.</i></p>
<p><i>Le gusta el café a mi hermano.</i></p>
<p><i>A mi hermano le gusta el café. </i></p>
</center>

<p>In all three sentences, the psychological verb gustar (like) has the theme/subject <i>café</i> and the experiencer/object <i>mi hermano</i> (my brother). The sentence <i>a</i> has an SVO order. Sentence <i>b</i> has an VSO order. And sentence <i>c</i> has an OVS order.</p>

<h4>Interrogative Clauses</h4>

<p>There are two types of interrogative clauses. The first type of clause is called <b>closed interrogatives</b> or yes/no questions.  The second type of clause is called <b>open interrogatives</b>, or Wh-questions. While the second type is usually more complicated (<i>and more interesting</i>) in the study of either language, their constructions are very similar. Therefore, we will discuss the closed interrogative clauses which have interesting contrasting structures in English and Spanish.</p>

<h5>Closed Interrogatives</h5>

<p>In English, to make an closed interrogative from a declarative clause, we can follow these steps: </p>

<ol>
<li>If the clause does not have an auxiliary, we add a dummy <b>do</b> in the same tense as the main verb and change the main verb to its plain form.</li>
<li>Then,  we exchange the positions of the subject with the auxiliary. (This is referred to as <b>Subject-Auxiliary Inversion</b>.) </li>
<li>And we add a question mark at the end of the clause.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider the following declarative sentence:</p> 

<center>
<p><i> Mary opened a restaurant.</i></p>
</center>

<p>Because the verb is tensed in the preterite tense and it does not have an auxiliary, then the first step to turn this clause into a closed interrogative is to add the dummy auxiliary <b>do</b> in the preterite tense: <i>did</i>. Then, we invert the positions of the subject and the auxiliary. And finally, we add the question mark. The end result is:</p> 

<center>
<p><i> Did Mary open a restaurant?</i></p>
</center>

<p>In Spanish, we can change a declarative clause into an interrogative one by <b>changing intonation</b> and <b>enclosing the clause in question marks</b>. For example, we can turn the following declarative clause:</p> 

<center>
<p><i>María abrió un restaurante.</i></p>
</center>

<p> into the following corresponding closed interrogative:</p> 

<center>
<p><i> ¿María abrió un restaurante?</i></p>
</center>

<p> Another interesting contrast to be made here is that the closed interrogative above can also be formulated as</p> 

<center>
<p><i> ¿Abrió María un restaurante?</i></p>
</center>

<p>where the clause has a VSO word order. Something that English does not allow.</p>

<h4>Impersonal verbs</h4>

<p>The so-called impersonal verbs are verbs which <b>can’t take any person as its subject</b>. These impersonal verbs include meteorological, climate, and temperature phenomena. The way that English solved the problem of subjects for impersonal verbs is by using a dummy <i>it</i>. For example,</p> 

<center>
<p><i> It is raining.</i></p>
<p><i>It is hot.</i></p>
</center>

<p>So, the subject in these sentences (the 3rd person pronoun <i>it</i>) doesn’t refer to any entity. They are just <b>filling the grammatical function of the subject</b>.</p>

<p>In Spanish, impersonal verbs take advantage of the fact that the language can have a <b>null-subject</b>. For example, the first sentence above would be translated as</p> 

<center>
<p><i> Esta lloviendo,</i></p>
</center>

<p>where there is no subject. If we were to translate literally, it would be the ungrammatical clause </p> 

<center>
<p><i>*Is raining.</i></p>
</center>

<p>While the verb <b>ser</b> (be) is used often with impersonal verbs in both languages, Spanish often uses the verb <b>hacer</b> (make) with verbs that refer to temperature. For example, the second sentence from above can be translated as</p> 

<center>
<p><i> Hace calor,</i></p>
</center>

<p>which, if we were to translate literally, we would say </p> 

<center>
<p><i>There is hot being made.</i></p>
</center>

<h4>Existential clauses</h4>

<p>In English, existential clauses have a dummy <i>there</i> as a subject and are <b>used to express the existence of something</b>. For example,</p> 

<center>
<p><i>There are sweets in the kitchen.</i></p>
<p><i>There is a new bike in our driveway.</i></p>
</center>

<p>We can tell that the subject <i>there</i> is not fulfilling a semantic role because the verb does not agree with it. Instead, it’s fulfilling a <b>purely grammatical role</b>, similar to the dummy <i>it</i> in clauses with impersonal verbs.</p>

<p>Spanish, on the other hand, is a null-subject language and does not require a grammatical subject in existential clauses. For example, the sentences above can be translated as</p> 

<center>
<p><i> Hay golosinas en la cocina.</i></p>
<p><i>Hay una nueva bicicleta en nuestra entrada.</i></p>
</center>
