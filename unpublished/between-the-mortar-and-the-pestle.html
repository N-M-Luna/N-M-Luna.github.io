<h2 class="essay-title"> Between the Mortar and the Pestle </h2>
<h3 class="by-line"> by Nathalie M. Luna | January 2021 </h3>

<p><i>The Old Fashioned</i> is a simple drink in the sense that it requires few ingredients; but its complexity lies in understanding how these interact with each other in that delicious way.</p>

<p><strong>The Mojito</strong>, on the other hand, I can't even make illusions of calling it simple; which is why it makes for an interesting discussion.</p>

<p>The star ingredient in the mojito, in my opinion, is <strong>the mint</strong>. When I started my training at <i>Willie's Bar and Grill</i>, my first bartending gig, I didn't hold this drink in very high esteem. </p>

<p>-<i>I don't like Mojitos</i>, I told my manager; a veteran in the industry who was showing me the basics of bartending. <i>I mean, the taste is OK, but I don't like it when I get bits of leaves from my straw.</i></p>

<p>-<i>Ah, sounds like they sold you sofrito</i>, she replied.</p>

<p>Then, she explained how she has been preparing this drink throughout the many years on the job.</p>

<p>First thing to do is <b>muddle three lime wedges and a teaspoon on granulated sugar in a highball glass</b>. The three wedges have the amount of juice and acidity necessary to dissolve the sugar without much effort. The mint leaves go next; before the ice and liquor.</p>

<p>-<i>You <b>slap the leaves</b> like this, as if you're hitting someone who insulted you. Then you put them in the glass and you're going to twist the muddler one or two times. No more than than! 'Cause we're not making sofrito.</i></p>

<p>Because the leaves were already "activated" when you slapped them, they don't need to be muddled or further bruised in order to release their aroma.</p>

<p>If we make the mistake of over-muddling the leaves, the drink will end up with bits of wilted green. And what an unpleasant experience it is when the unsuspecting drinker gets some of these bits in the middle of a sip! Not to mention when they're swallowed by mistake, sending the drinker into a coughing fit.</p>

<p>After the mint, <b>we add ice, two ounces of white rum, and top it off with soda or mineral water.</b> To finish it, we stir the drink (slowly to not disturb the bubbles too much) until the mint and lime wedges are distributed evenly in the glass. Besides from giving the drink a pretty look, this serves to distribute the flavor.</p>

<p>The bartender who goes the extra mile will add some finishing touches: <b>a small twig of mint and a fresh lime wedge on the rim of the glass</b>, which are aesthetic details more than anything else.</p>

<p>The mint and the bubbles will cool and refresh the drinker, something that so many people came looking for at that bar in some hidden beach of Rinc√≥n. </p>
