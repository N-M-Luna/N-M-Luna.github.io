<h2> About me. </h2>

<p>Born in Puerto Rico, I have been <b>bilingual</b> since a young age. Even as a <b>master's student of English with a concentration in Linguistics</b>, I have been maintaining a complementary independent study of Spanish. </p>

<p>My interest in <i>comparative linguistics</i> and <i>translation</i> started from my bilingual upbringing. In college, I took two semesters of Japanese just see such a contrasting language. Little did I know that years later, a <b><i>Japan Society for the Promotion for Science</i> Fellowship</b> would be sending me to Yamaguchi, Japan for a summer of research. </p>

<p>I love to write in both Spanish and English. I have co-authored two <b>academic papers</b> while pursuing my <b>master's in mathematics</b>. Out of my experience in the mathematics community, came two <b>published essays</b>. </p> 

<p>Since I graduated in 2018, I have been <b>lecturing</b> online from Sacramento, CA at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. I'm interested in making a career change into the publishing industry. </p>

<p>My hobbies include <i>calligraphy, crochet,</i> and <i>reading</i>. </p>
